# Property Title Smart Contract

This is a Ethereum based Smart Contract for decentralized property title listing. Users are able to mint their own token to represent their tutke ti the property. Therefore, proof of ownership is needed. zk-SNARKs are used to create a verification system which can proof the user has title to the property without revealing specific information on the property. Once the token is verified the user is able to place it on a bkockchain market place (OpenSea) for others to purchase.
